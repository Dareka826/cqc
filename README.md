# C? compiler
-

# Project structure
- `src/` is where all the source files live
- `obj/` is where the compilation happens
- The build is managed by `redo` (I use Leah's [`redo-c`](https://github.com/leahneukirchen/redo-c))

# What is C?
- A language that aims to be low level, but safer than C
- Compiles to ANSI C, so all the tools you're familiar with should work
- Introduces niceties from newer languages
- Avoids ambiguity
- No hidden control flow
- Compatibility with C libraries
